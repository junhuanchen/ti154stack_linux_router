It includes a full Linux user-space software that runs on top of the TI Processor SDK for <a href=\"http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/processors/sitara/arm_cortex-a8/am335x/overview.page\">AM335x platform</a>, which interfaces with the co-processor embedded implementation of TI 15.4-Stack running on the companion SimpleLink CC13xx wireless MCU.</p> <p>The software middleware included in the SDK provides a high level TCP socket interface for the application, de-facto implementing an IP-Sub-1 GHz gateway and allowing seamless integration with IP-based applications like web-servers, web-sockets or generic <a href=\"http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDEP0084\">cloud server applications running popular protocols based on MQTT</a> or HTTP.</p> <p>The SDK includes a web example application on how to use the socket interface to jump-start application development and easily prototype gateway solutions.</p>"
